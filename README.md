Pushed here the files from the Codecademy "Messages project" 

Message generator project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomised output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customise it to your liking.
